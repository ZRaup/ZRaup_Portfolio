### About the Project:

The goal of this project was to develop an interactive museum map that visualizes popular visitor paths and the average number of visitors in each room throughout the day. The animation begins at 8:00 AM when the museum opens and concludes at 9:00 PM. This visualization allows for a dynamic understanding of visitor flow and room occupancy at different times of the day, providing valuable insights into visitor behavior and space utilization.

The interactive animation allows users to hover over each room in the museum and see a guide that displays the visitor path, room name, hour of the day, and average number of visitors in the room for that hour. The size of the path line in the animation represents the number of people in that room. To maintain simplicity and clarity, only two paths are displayed in the visualization.

The project was undertaken as part of the 'Data Visualization in Tableau' course, where I applied advanced data visualization techniques to transform cleaned museum data into a meaningful and engaging interactive experience. By leveraging Tableau's powerful features, I was able to create a comprehensive and user-friendly tool that highlights key patterns and trends in museum visitor behavior. This project not only demonstrates my proficiency in using Tableau for data visualization but also underscores the practical application of these skills in real-world scenarios.


###### Below are screenshots from the animation, which can be used to extract valuable insights.

##### Image 1: Crowded Cafe at 11 pm
Ths screenshot shows 3,164 visitors in the cafe at 11 am. Notice the size of the line in path A tends to be longer towards the begining of the muesue and gets smaller towards the end of the visitors path.
Key Insight:

##### Image 2:  3pm
Both Path A and Path E at 3pm shows a high concentration of the visitors in the middle of the muesuem and also a high number of visitors located at the exit.  
Key Insight:

##### Image 3:  6pm
At 6pm the animation shows visitors working their way towards the exit of the musuem with less visitors on the paths than previous hours. The highest concentration of visitors is close to the exit and middle area of the musuem.  
Key Insight:

### Conclusion
a great resouce for visualizing visitor traffic befavour

Project Overview:

This projec is apart of the 'Data Visualiztion in Tableau' course on Data Camp. 

The project was undertaken as part of the 'Data Visualization in Tableau' course, where I applied advanced data visualization techniques to transform raw museum data into a meaningful and engaging interactive experience. By leveraging Tableau's powerful features, I was able to create a comprehensive and user-friendly tool that highlights key patterns and trends in museum visitor behavior. This project not only demonstrates my proficiency in using Tableau for data visualization but also underscores the practical application of these skills in real-world scenarios.
