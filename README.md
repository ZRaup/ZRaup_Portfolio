# [Project 1: Using MCMC in Python to Determine Parameter Values of an Exoplanet](TOI4153.ipynb)(lightkurve.png)

This is part of an astrophysics research project that I presented at the 241 AAS meeting
  - Utilizes a Log likelyhood funtion and Monte Carlo Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorythm to understand the probability distribution of important exoplanet parameter values
  - Creates a model of an exoplanet transit based on known parameters of TOI-4153
  - Code plots a light curve of the exoplanet transit based on photomtry data
  - Data was taken from the 0.61 m telescope at the CR Chambliss Astronomical Observatory in Kutztown, Pa.
