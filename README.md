### About Me
Welcome to my data science portfolio. I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Kutztown University with a bachelor's degree in Physics, driven by an insatiable curiosity and a passion for data-driven exploration. Throughout my academic journey, I specialized in data analysis and modeling, particularly in the realms of exoplanets and binary stars. This experience not only deepened my understanding of complex datasets but also honed my skills in extracting meaningful insights.

Professionally, I have developed robust capabilities in Python for data analysis, leveraging techniques such as exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and statistical modeling. I am proficient in SQL querying, adept at managing and extracting insights from large datasets to support data-driven decision-making. Additionally, I possess advanced skills in data visualization using Tableau and Power BI, creating insightful visualizations that effectively communicate findings and support strategic initiatives.

I am dedicated to applying my expertise in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools to solve challenging problems and contribute meaningfully to data-driven projects. I thrive in collaborative environments and am committed to continuous learning and professional growth in the dynamic field of data science.


Below is a select list of data and coding projects that I have completed:

## [Project 1: Utilizing MCMC in Python to Explore the Parameter Space of an Exoplanet](TOI4153_port.ipynb)

### Objective: 
##### Using MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) to determine probability distributions of exoplanet parameters (Radius of Planet, Impact Parameter, Time of Mid-Transit) based on photometry data.

### Methodology:
##### - Develops a log likelihood function and applies MCMC algorithm to explore parameter space and quantify uncertainties.
##### - Constructs an exoplanet transit model using known parameters of TOI-4153.

### Data Source: 
##### Utilizes photometry data obtained from the 0.61 m telescope at the CR Chambliss Astronomical Observatory in Kutztown, PA.

### Visualization: 
##### Includes plotting of light curves, histograms, and cornerplots in matplotlib to visualize and analyze the exoplanet transit based on the photometry data.

### Presentation: 
##### Presented at the 241st AAS (American Astronomical Society) meeting.
