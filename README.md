# [Project 1: Analyzing Exoplanet Data](https://zraup.github.io/ZRaup_Portfolio/)

This is part of an astrophysics research project I worked on while at the Kutztown University
  - Data was taken from the 0.61 m telescope at the CR Chambliss Astronomical Observatory in Kutztown, Pa.
  - Code plots the lightcurve of the transiting exoplanet around its host star
